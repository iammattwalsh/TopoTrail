# TopoTrail

## Overview

Hikers, climbers, cyclists, and other outdoor enthusiasts are missing an important resource in understanding the areas they plan to explore: intuitively accessed tools to aid in understanding of the terrain. Terrain factors into both general supply preparation (e.g. energy expenditure requiring different trail food) and risk factoring (e.g. awareness of nearby cliffs or other terrain-based hazards).

The goal of TopoTrail is to help users understand and prepare to safely navigate trails and other outdoor terrain through 3D visualization.

TopoTrail was built with Django, Vue, ThreeJS, & Materialize.



This project was built in a 4-week period as a capstone project for a full stack web developer bootcamp.
